/**
 * You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age.
 * When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully
 * blow out.
 * For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3,
 * she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4  and there are 2 such candles
